# [RISC-V][riscv] resource page

Studying a concrete real-world processor is not just relevant for the
architecture course. A course in compilers or operating systems will
benefit from fixing such a processor. [RISC-V][riscv] in many ways
fits the bill.  This repository and its associated wiki contains
resource material on [RISC-V][riscv] curated in a form that would be
useful for teaching in IIT Palakkad.
